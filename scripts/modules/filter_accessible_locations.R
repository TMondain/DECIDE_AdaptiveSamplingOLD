# **5. Accessible locations**
#   
#  Identify accessible features (footpaths, parks, etc) within the area of interest
# 
# _Input_: Spatial layer of accessible locations [one or all of footpaths, parks, etc]; point location; buffer
# 
# _Output_: Spatial subset of accessible locations with their metadata
# 
# _Metadata_: Buffer size, spatial layer used

# This could be generalised to take any prow, accesspoints or greenspace (or any combination)
# to make this transferable to other countries
